## Issues Resolved {large-bold}

:::card {subtle-glass}
### Heavy-Glass Border Conflict

**Problem:**  
The `heavy-glass` card variant had a plain white border due to conflicting CSS classes. The card definition included `border-white/60` which overrode the glassmorphism CSS border styling.

**Solution:**  
- Removed all conflicting Tailwind border utility classes from glass card variants
- Fixed CSS gradient border implementation to eliminate visual overlapping artifacts
- Implemented proper shorthand syntax: `linear-gradient(...) padding-box, linear-gradient(...) border-box`
- Removed duplicate `background-clip` properties

**Result:** Clean, professional gradient borders with no visual artifacts

### Medium-Glass Missing Variant

**Problem:**  
No `medium-glass` variant existed. Users could use `{glass}` but not `{medium-glass}` for consistency with other glass variants.

**Solution:**  
Added `medium-glass` as an alias for the `glass` variant in both component definition and shorthand mappings.

**Result:** Consistent naming across all glass variants

### Premium Gradient Borders

**Problem:**  
Glass variants used plain solid white borders lacking professional aesthetic quality.

**Solution:**  
Implemented premium gradient borders:
- **Subtle-Glass:** White shimmer gradient (35% → 15% → 35%)
- **Light-Glass:** White shimmer gradient (30% → 12% → 30%)  
- **Medium-Glass:** White shimmer gradient (25% → 10% → 25%)
- **Heavy-Glass:** Blue-cyan gradient with subtle color shimmer

**Result:** High-grade professional UI/UX standards achieved

## Technical Implementation {large-bold}

:::card {heavy-glass}
### CSS Gradient Border Technique

The premium borders use proper CSS shorthand syntax:

```css
.glass-heavy {
  border: 1px solid transparent;
  background: 
    linear-gradient(rgba(...), rgba(...)) padding-box,
    linear-gradient(135deg, ...) border-box;
}
```

**Key improvements:**
- Single `background` property with dual gradients
- Proper `padding-box` and `border-box` application
- No duplicate `background-clip` declarations
- Eliminates visual artifacts and overlapping appearance

### Heavy-Glass Border Palette

The heavy-glass border uses a professional blue-cyan gradient:

| Color | RGB | Opacity | Description |
|-------|-----|---------|-------------|
| White corners | `255, 255, 255` | 20% | Subtle highlights |
| Sky cyan | `56, 189, 248` | 12% | Bright cyan accent |
| Sky blue | `14, 165, 233` | 12% | Deep blue center |
| Blue accent | `59, 130, 246` | 12% | Rich blue tone |

**No purple tones** - Professional blue-cyan gradient only
