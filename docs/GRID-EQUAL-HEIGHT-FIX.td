# Grid Equal Height Fix {huge-bold center primary}

Zero-config grid beauty with equal-height card rows {large muted center}

---

## Issue Identified {large-bold}

**Problem:** Cards within grid layouts were not stretching to equal heights, creating visually awkward rows that violated our high UI/UX standards for zero-config beauty.

**Visual Issue:**
- Cards with less content appeared shorter
- Rows looked uneven and misaligned
- Bottom edges didn't align properly
- Not meeting professional UI standards

---

## Solution {large-bold}

Applied CSS Grid best practices to ensure all grid items stretch to equal heights within their row.

### CSS Changes

**File:** `packages/compiler/src/renderer/css.ts` (lines 1136-1153)

```css
.component-grid {
  /* Ensure grid items stretch to equal heights */
  align-items: stretch;
}

/* Make all direct children of grid stretch to full height */
.component-grid > * {
  height: 100%;
  display: flex;
  flex-direction: column;
}

/* Ensure cards in grids stretch to equal heights */
.component-grid .component-card {
  height: 100%;
  display: flex;
  flex-direction: column;
}
```

---

## How It Works {large-bold}

### 1. Grid Container

```css
.component-grid {
  align-items: stretch;
}
```

**Purpose:** Tells the CSS Grid to stretch all items to the full height of their row (this is actually the default, but being explicit ensures no conflicts).

### 2. Direct Children

```css
.component-grid > * {
  height: 100%;
  display: flex;
  flex-direction: column;
}
```

**Purpose:** 
- `height: 100%` - Takes full height allocated by grid
- `display: flex` - Enables flexbox for internal content distribution
- `flex-direction: column` - Stacks content vertically

### 3. Cards in Grids

```css
.component-grid .component-card {
  height: 100%;
  display: flex;
  flex-direction: column;
}
```

**Purpose:** Specifically targets cards within grids to ensure they stretch properly even when nested.

## Technical Details {large-bold}

### CSS Grid Auto-Height Behavior

By default, CSS Grid creates rows with height determined by the tallest item in that row. Our fix ensures:

1. **Row Height:** Determined by tallest card
2. **All Items:** Stretch to match row height
3. **Content:** Flexbox distributes content within available space
4. **Result:** Perfect visual alignment

### Flexbox Column Layout

Using `flex-direction: column` ensures:
- Content flows top to bottom
- Natural reading order preserved
- Footer content can use `margin-top: auto` to stick to bottom

## Testing {large-bold}

Verified across multiple files:

**Grid with 3 Cards (varying content):**
```taildown
:::grid
:::card {elevated}
Short content
:::

:::card {elevated}
Medium amount of content with multiple paragraphs
:::

:::card {elevated}
Tiny
:::
:::
```

**Result:** :icon[check]{success} All three cards now have equal height, matching the tallest
