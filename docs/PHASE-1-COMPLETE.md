## Bugs Fixed This Phase

### Critical Bugs ✅

1. **Layout Catastrophe**
   - **Issue:** Entire page squeezed into narrow column
   - **Fix:** Added missing closing fence
   - **Impact:** Restored proper full-width layouts

2. **Closing Fences Without Blank Lines**
   - **Issue:** `:::` appearing as literal text
   - **Fix:** Recursive list scanning + multiple fence extraction
   - **Impact:** More forgiving, intuitive syntax

3. **CSS Responsive Classes Not Working**
   - **Issue:** Grid not expanding on wide screens
   - **Fix:** Escaped colons in CSS selectors
   - **Impact:** Professional responsive layouts

4. **Poor Viewport Utilization**
   - **Issue:** Only ~30% of screen used
   - **Fix:** Increased container max-width, added xl/2xl breakpoints
   - **Impact:** Full-width professional layouts

5. **Component Nesting with Blank Lines**
   - **Issue:** `remark-directive` couldn't handle siblings with blank lines
   - **Fix:** Custom directive parser
   - **Impact:** Perfect nesting, SYNTAX.md compliance

6. **Link Attributes Applied to Paragraph**
   - **Issue:** `[Link](#){.class}` classes applied to `<p>` not `<a>`
   - **Fix:** Reordered visit calls (links before paragraphs)
   - **Impact:** Correct attribute attachment

7. **Button Styling**
   - **Issue:** Underlined links, no visual feedback
   - **Fix:** shadcn-inspired 3D effects with hover/active states
   - **Impact:** Professional, interactive buttons

   - Full control over parsing
   - Can evolve syntax independently

3. **User-Focused Debugging**

   - Fixed actual problems, not symptoms
   - Achieved "zero config beauty" goal

4. **Performance First**
   - Sub-linear scaling by design
   - Exceeded targets significantly
   - No optimization needed yet

### What We'd Do Differently

1. **Start with Custom Parser**
   - Could have saved time
   - But: learned what edge cases to handle

2. **Automated Visual Testing**
