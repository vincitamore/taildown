:icon[book-open]{info} **TL;DR** - This article covers modern web architecture patterns including microservices, serverless, and edge computing. We'll explore when to use each approach and provide real-world examples.
:::

## Introduction {xl-bold}

The landscape of web development has evolved dramatically over the past decade. What worked five years ago might not be the best approach today. {large relaxed-lines}

In this article, we'll explore three major architectural patterns and when to use each:

1. Monolithic Architecture
2. Microservices Architecture  
3. Serverless Architecture

Let's dive in! {large relaxed-lines}

## :icon[box]{primary} Monolithic Architecture {xl-bold fade-in}

### What It Is {large-bold}

A monolithic application is a single, unified codebase that handles all functionality. {relaxed-lines}

:::card {light-glass}
### :icon[thumbs-up]{success} Pros 

- :icon[check]{success xs} **Simple to develop** - Everything in one place
- :icon[check]{success xs} **Easy to deploy** - Single deployment unit
- :icon[check]{success xs} **Strong consistency** - Direct database access
- :icon[check]{success xs} **Better for small teams** - Less coordination needed
:::

:::card {subtle-glass}
### :icon[thumbs-down]{error} Cons 

- :icon[x]{error xs} **Difficult to scale** - Must scale entire application
- :icon[x]{error xs} **Technology lock-in** - One framework/language for everything
- :icon[x]{error xs} **Slower deployments** - Small changes require full rebuild
- :icon[x]{error xs} **Harder to maintain** - Codebase grows complex over time

### When to Use {large-bold}

### :icon[rocket]{warning} Early Stage Startups
When you need to move fast and validate ideas quickly.
:::

:::card {elevated interactive hover-lift}
### :icon[users]{info} Small Teams
When you have < 10 developers working on the project.
:::

:::card {elevated interactive hover-lift}
### :icon[target]{success} Simple Applications
When requirements are straightforward and unlikely to change.

## :icon[grid]{secondary} Microservices Architecture {xl-bold fade-in}

### What It Is {large-bold}

Microservices break an application into small, independent services that communicate via APIs. {relaxed-lines}

:::card {elevated}
### Example Architecture

```
         API Gateway                 
         ↓    ↓    ↓    ↓                                  
      ┌──────┬───────┬───────┬─────────┐
      │ Auth │ Users │Orders │ Payment │
      └──────┴───────┴───────┴─────────┘
         ↓      ↓       ↓        ↓              
         Database Layer
```

### Benefits {large-bold}

:::grid
:::card {light-glass slide-up}
#### :icon[trending-up]{success lg} Independent Scaling
Scale services based on demand. Payment service getting hammered? Scale it independently.
:::

:::card {light-glass slide-up}
#### :icon[layers]{info lg} Technology Flexibility
Use the best tool for each job. Node.js for real-time, Go for high-throughput, Python for ML.
:::

:::card {light-glass slide-up}
#### :icon[package]{primary lg} Isolated Deployments
Deploy services independently. Bug fix in auth service? Deploy it without touching anything else.
:::

:::card {light-glass slide-up}
#### :icon[users]{secondary lg} Team Autonomy
Teams own services end-to-end. Less coordination, faster decisions.

### Challenges {large-bold}

> "With microservices, you're trading one set of problems for another. Make sure the tradeoff is worth it."
> — Martin Fowler

:::alert {warning}
:icon[alert-triangle]{warning} **Key Challenges:**

- **Distributed Complexity** - Network calls can fail, latency increases
- **Data Consistency** - Maintaining consistency across services is hard
- **Operational Overhead** - More services = more to monitor and maintain
- **Testing Difficulty** - Integration testing becomes more complex

## :icon[zap]{warning} Serverless Architecture {xl-bold fade-in}

### What It Is {large-bold}

Serverless lets you run code without managing servers. You write functions, and the cloud provider handles everything else. {relaxed-lines}

:::card {elevated}
### Popular Serverless Platforms

| Platform | Provider | Language Support |
|----------|----------|------------------|
| AWS Lambda | Amazon | Node.js, Python, Go, Java, .NET, Ruby |
| Cloud Functions | Google | Node.js, Python, Go, Java, .NET, Ruby, PHP |
| Azure Functions | Microsoft | Node.js, Python, C#, Java, PowerShell |
| Cloudflare Workers | Cloudflare | JavaScript, Rust, C, C++ (WASM) |

### Use Cases {large-bold}

:::grid
:::card {light-glass zoom-in}
#### :icon[globe]{primary} API Backends
Handle HTTP requests with auto-scaling and pay-per-use pricing.
:::

:::card {light-glass zoom-in}
#### :icon[database]{info} Data Processing
Process events from queues, transform data, generate reports.
:::

:::card {light-glass zoom-in}
#### :icon[clock]{success} Scheduled Tasks
Run cron jobs without maintaining servers.
:::

:::card {light-glass zoom-in}
#### :icon[cpu]{secondary} Edge Computing
Run code close to users for minimal latency.

## :icon[compass]{primary} Making the Right Choice {xl-bold fade-in}

Here's a decision framework to help you choose: {large relaxed-lines}

:::container
:::grid
:::card {subtle-glass slide-up}
### :icon[box]{primary} Choose Monolith If...
- :icon[check]{success xs} Team < 10 developers
- :icon[check]{success xs} Simple, well-defined requirements
- :icon[check]{success xs} Need to move fast initially
- :icon[check]{success xs} Limited operations expertise
:::

:::card {light-glass slide-up}
### :icon[grid]{info} Choose Microservices If...
- :icon[check]{success xs} Team > 20 developers
- :icon[check]{success xs} Different parts scale differently
- :icon[check]{success xs} Need independent deployments
- :icon[check]{success xs} Have ops expertise
:::

:::card {heavy-glass slide-up}
### :icon[zap]{warning} Choose Serverless If...
- :icon[check]{success xs} Unpredictable traffic patterns
- :icon[check]{success xs} Want minimal ops overhead
- :icon[check]{success xs} Event-driven workloads
- :icon[check]{success xs} Cost optimization critical

## :icon[briefcase]{secondary} Real-World Example {xl-bold fade-in}

Let's look at how a real company evolved their architecture. {large relaxed-lines}

:::card {elevated}
### Case Study: PhotoShare

**2020 - Monolith** :icon[box]{primary}  
Started with Rails monolith, 3 developers, 1K users. Deployed to Heroku. Simple and fast.

**2022 - Hybrid** :icon[git-branch]{info}  
Split image processing into separate service (Node.js). Still monolith for core features. 50K users, 12 developers.

**2024 - Microservices** :icon[grid]{success}  
Full microservices for auth, users, photos, social, notifications. 500K users, 45 developers across 6 teams.

**2025 - Serverless Functions** :icon[zap]{warning}  
Added serverless functions for image thumbnails, video transcoding, and AI features. Edge functions for image delivery.

:::alert {success}
:icon[lightbulb]{success} **Key Lesson:** Evolution, not revolution. They didn't rewrite everything at once.

## Conclusion {xl-bold}

There's no one-size-fits-all architecture. The best choice depends on your team size, scale requirements, and operational maturity. {large relaxed-lines}

Start simple, measure everything, and evolve as needed. {large relaxed-lines bold}
