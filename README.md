# taildown
Ok, so I want your help building this idea. What I'm thinking of I'm calling "Taildown" and is essentially Markdown, but with some added additional styling commands inspired by and pulled from Tailwind and shadcn. Like I want to be easily create grid layouts with perfectly styled 3D cards, included Lucide icon packs, all done in nearly plain English and still highly readable. And all the most widely used and popular tailwind css stylings in plain English, with various components easily invokable, and then compiled to a static html that all perfectly flex sized and laid out with built responsive adaption to different viewport sizes. I'm not sure all what this will involve and I'll need your help for a lot, roughly I've thought it involves developing the syntax first, then a lightweight fast engine, and then a lightweight yet fully featured and beautiful in it's own right editor. Please do any research you see fit, and then create an intial tech-spec.md report for this idea.
