# Documentation Site Status

## Completed

- Dark mode toggle button now creates correctly and appears in DOM
- Auto-fixer system working for syntax errors
- Button components have all variants including accent and info
- Simplified hero section with clean single CTA button
- All markdown documentation files deleted per PROJECT-RULES

## Current State

All 3 pages compiled successfully with dark mode enabled by default.

Hero section redesigned to be minimal and clean:
- Large heading
- Subtitle and description
- Single prominent "Get Started" button
- Clean horizontal rule separators

Dark mode toggle should now appear in bottom-right corner and respond to:
- Click to toggle theme
- System preference detection on first visit
- LocalStorage persistence across sessions

## Files

- index.html (main landing page)
- getting-started.html (quick start guide)  
- vercel-deployment.html (deployment instructions)

All files are self-contained with embedded CSS and JavaScript.
